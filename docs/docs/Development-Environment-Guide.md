# Overview

The following instructions are for setting up an environment for building and running OpenMPF outside of Docker. They serve as a reference for developers who want to develop the Workflow Manager web application itself and perform end-to-end integration testing.

If your environment is behind a proxy server, please refer to the [Proxy Configuration](#proxy-configuration) and [SSL Inspection](#ssl-inspection) appendix sections before continuing. Keep them in mind throughout this guide and perform the configuration steps as necessary.


# Install CentOS 7

The recommended minimum system specifications are:

- **Memory**: 8192MB
- **CPU**: 4
- **Disk**: 40GB on a SSD

Install [CentOS 7](https://www.centos.org/download/). Most developers use a virtual machine for development.


# Install System Dependencies Using Package Managers

<h2>Configure Additional Repositories</h2>

1. Install the Remi Repo for Redis:
    1. `wget -P /home/mpf/Downloads "http://rpms.remirepo.net/RPM-GPG-KEY-remi"`
    2. `wget -P /home/mpf/Downloads "http://rpms.famillecollet.com/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm"`
    3. `sudo rpm --import /home/mpf/Downloads/RPM-GPG-KEY-remi`
    4. `sudo rpm -Uvh /home/mpf/Downloads/remi-release-7.rpm`
    5. `sudo yum-config-manager --enable remi`
2. Create an `/apps` directory and package subdirectories:
    1. `sudo mkdir -p /apps/install/lib`
    2. `sudo mkdir -p /apps/bin/apache`
    3. `sudo mkdir /apps/ansible`
    4. `sudo mkdir -p /apps/source/cmake_sources`
    5. `sudo mkdir /apps/source/apache_sources`
    6. `sudo mkdir /apps/source/google_sources`
    7. `sudo mkdir /apps/source/opencv_sources`
    8. `sudo mkdir /apps/source/ffmpeg_sources`
    9. `sudo mkdir /apps/source/dlib-sources`
    10. `sudo mkdir /apps/source/openalpr_sources`
    11. `sudo mkdir /apps/source/ansible_sources`
    12. `sudo chown -R mpf:mpf /apps`
    13. `sudo chmod -R 755 /apps`
3. Create the OpenMPF `ldconfig` file:
    <br>`sudo touch /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mpf-x86_64.conf`
4. Add `/apps/install/lib` to the OpenMPF `ldconfig` file:
    <br>`sudo sh -c 'echo "/apps/install/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mpf-x86_64.conf'`
5. Update the shared library cache:
    <br>`sudo ldconfig`

<h2>Install System Dependencies via Yum</h2>

Use `yum` to install packages:

`sudo yum install -y asciidoc autoconf automake boost boost-devel cmake3 curl freetype-devel gcc-c++ git graphviz gstreamer-plugins-base-devel gtk2-devel gtkglext-devel gtkglext-libs jasper jasper-devel libavc1394-devel libcurl-devel libdc1394-devel libffi-devel libICE-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel libpng-devel libSM-devel libtiff-devel libtool libv4l-devel libXinerama-devel libXmu-devel libXt-devel log4cplus log4cplus-devel log4cxx log4cxx-devel make mercurial mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel nasm ncurses-devel numpy openssl-devel pangox-compat pangox-compat-devel perl-CPAN-Meta-YAML perl-DBI perl-Digest-MD5 perl-File-Find-Rule perl-File-Find-Rule-Perl perl-JSON perl-JSON-PP perl-List-Compare perl-Number-Compare perl-Params-Util perl-Parse-CPAN-Meta php pkgconfig qt qt-devel qt-x11 redis rpm-build sshpass tbb tbb-devel tree unzip uuid-devel wget yasm yum-utils zlib-devel`


# Get the OpenMPF Source Code

1. Clone the OpenMPF projects repository:
    1. `cd /home/mpf`
    2. `git clone https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-projects.git --recursive`

2. Install the OpenMPF command line tools:
    <br> `sudo pip3 install /home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf/trunk/bin/mpf-scripts`

3. Copy the mpf user profile script from the extracted source code:
    <br> `sudo cp /home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf/trunk/mpf-install/src/main/scripts/mpf-profile.sh /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh`

4. Add `/apps/install/bin` to the system `PATH` variable:
    1. `sudo sh -c 'echo "PATH=\$PATH:/apps/install/bin" >> /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh'`
    2. `. /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh`

For more information on the command line tools, please refer to the [Command Line Tools](#command-line-tools) section below.

<h2>Add Maven Dependencies</h2>

Some Maven dependencies needed for OpenMPF are not publicly available.

1. Download [mpf-maven-deps.tar.gz](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-build-tools/blob/master/mpf-maven-deps.tar.gz) to `/home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf-build-tools/mpf-maven-deps.tar.gz`.
2. Set up the local Maven repository:
    1. `cd /home/mpf`
    2. `mkdir -p .m2/repository`
3. Extract the archive to the local Maven repository:
<br>`tar xvzf /home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf-build-tools/mpf-maven-deps.tar.gz -C /home/mpf/.m2/repository/`


# Build and Install System Dependencies in Dockerfiles

Refer to the `openmpf_build` [Dockerfile](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/develop/openmpf_build/Dockerfile), and execute the `RUN` steps to build/install the required dependencies in your local development environment. Use your best judgement. You will need to run some commands with `sudo` root privileges. Some of these may be redundant with the steps you've followed so far. Installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit is optional. Refer to the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](#nvidia-cuda-toolkit) section below.

The `openmpf_build` Dockerfile may not include the dependencies you need to develop specific components. Refer to the Dockerfile for each of those components to determine which dependencies they require.

<h2>NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit</h2>

Installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit is optional, and only necessary if you need to run a component on a GPU. Many components that support GPU processing also support execution on the CPU, and if this toolkit is not found in the build environment, the build system will automatically build those components for CPU processing only. For a discussion of NVIDIA GPU support in OpenMPF components, see the [GPU Support Guide](GPU-Support-Guide/index.html).

> **NOTE:** To run OpenMPF components that use the NVIDIA GPUs, you must ensure that the deployment machine has the same version of this Toolkit installed, including the NVIDIA GPU drivers. The instructions here are for a development environment only, and thus do not include steps to install the drivers. If you also need to set up the deployment machine, please see the full instructions at <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html>.

# Configure System Dependencies

<h2>Configure ActiveMQ</h2>

Some additional manual configuration of ActiveMQ is required. For each step, open the specified file in a text editor, make the change, and save the file. If ActiveMQ is running, please stop it before making these changes.

**Use Additional Memory**

In `/opt/activemq/bin/env` (line 27), comment out the line:

```
ACTIVEMQ_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms64M -Xmx1G"
```

so that it reads:

```
#ACTIVEMQ_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms64M -Xmx1G"
```

**Disable Persistence**

In `/opt/activemq/conf/activemq.xml` (line 40), change the line:

```
<broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core" brokerName="localhost" dataDirectory="${activemq.data}">
```

so that it reads:

```
<broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core" brokerName="localhost" dataDirectory="${activemq.data}" persistent="false">
```

**Respect Priorities**

In `/opt/activemq/conf/activemq.xml` (line 44) under the line:

```
<policyEntries>
```

add the line:

```
<policyEntry queue=">" prioritizedMessages="true" useCache="false" expireMessagesPeriod="0" queuePrefetch="1" />
```

**Enable JMX**

In `/opt/activemq/conf/activemq.xml` (line 72, after making the above addition), change the line:

```
<managementContext createConnector="false"/>
```

so that it reads:

```
<managementContext createConnector="true"/>
```

**Change Log Conversion Pattern**

In `/opt/activemq/conf/log4j.properties` (line 52), change the line:

```
log4j.appender.logfile.layout.ConversionPattern=%d | %-5p | %m | %c | %t%n
```

so that it reads:

```
log4j.appender.logfile.layout.ConversionPattern=%d %p [%t] %c - %m%n
```

<h2>Configure Redis</h2>

Redis should be set to run in the background (i.e. as a daemon process).

In `/etc/redis.conf` (line 136), change the line:

```
daemonize no
```

so that it reads:

```
daemonize yes
```

# Configure Users

To change the default user password settings, modify `/home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf/trunk/workflow-manager/src/main/resources/properties/user.properties`. Note that the default settings are public knowledge, which could be a security risk.

Note that `mpf remove-user` and `mpf add-user` commands explained in the [Command Line Tools](#command-line-tools) section do not modify the `user.properties` file. If you remove a user using the `mpf remove-user` command, the changes will take effect at runtime, but an entry may still exist for that user in the `user.properties` file. If so, then the user account will be recreated the next time the Workflow Manager is restarted.

# Configure Tomcat with HTTP

When developing OpenMPF on a local machine, it is often most convenient to configure Tomcat to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

1. Open the file `/opt/apache-tomcat/conf/server.xml` in a text editor.
2. Below the commented out section on lines 87 through 90, remove the following lines if they exist:
<pre><code>&#60;Connector SSLEnabled="true" acceptCount="100" clientAuth="false"
	disableUploadTimeout="true" enableLookups="false" maxThreads="25"
	port="8443" keystoreFile="/home/mpf/.keystore" keystorePass="mpf123"
	protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" scheme="https"
	secure="true" sslProtocol="TLS" /&#62;</code></pre>
3. Save and close the file.
4. Create the file `/opt/apache-tomcat/bin/setenv.sh` and open it in a text editor.
5. Add the following line:
<pre><code>export CATALINA_OPTS="-server -Xms256m -XX:PermSize=512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Djava.library.path=$MPF_HOME/lib -Dtransport.guarantee='NONE' -Dweb.rest.protocol='http'"</code></pre>
6. Save and close the file.

# (Optional) Configure Tomcat with HTTPS

Alternatively, OpenMPF can also be run using HTTPS instead of HTTP.

**Generate a self-signed certificate and keystore**

A valid keystore is required to run OpenMPF with HTTPS support. These instructions will generate a keystore that should be used for local builds only. When deploying OpenMPF, a keystore containing a valid certificate trust chain should be used.

1. Open a new terminal window.
2.  `sudo systemctl stop tomcat7`
3. `cd /home/mpf`
4. `$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA`
5. At the prompt, enter a keystore password of: `mpf123`
6. Re-enter the keystore password of: `mpf123`
7. At the `What is your first and last name?` prompt, press the Enter key for a blank value.
8. At the `What is the name of your organizational unit?` , press the Enter key for a blank value.
9. At the `What is the name of your organization?` prompt, press the Enter key for a blank value.
10. At the `What is the name of your City or Locality?` prompt, press the Enter key for a blank value.
11. At the `What is the name of your State or Province?` prompt, press the Enter key for a blank value.
12. At the `What is the two-letter country code for this unit?` prompt, press the Enter key for a blank value.
13. At the `Is CN=Unknown, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown correct?` prompt, type `yes` and press the Enter key to accept the values.
14. At the `Enter key password for <tomcat>` prompt, press the Enter key for a blank value.
15. Verify the file `/home/mpf/.keystore` was created at the current time.

**Tomcat Configuration**

1. Open the file `/opt/apache-tomcat/conf/server.xml` in a text editor.
2. Below the commented out section on lines 87 through 90, add the following lines:
<pre><code>&#60;Connector SSLEnabled="true" acceptCount="100" clientAuth="false"
	disableUploadTimeout="true" enableLookups="false" maxThreads="25"
	port="8443" keystoreFile="/home/mpf/.keystore" keystorePass="mpf123"
	protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" scheme="https"
	secure="true" sslProtocol="TLS" /&#62;</code></pre>
3. Save and close the file.
4. Create the file `/opt/apache-tomcat/bin/setenv.sh` and open it in a text editor.
5. Add the following line:
<pre><code>export CATALINA_OPTS="-server -Xms256m -XX:PermSize=512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Djava.library.path=$MPF_HOME/lib -Dtransport.guarantee='CONFIDENTIAL' -Dweb.rest.protocol='https'"</code></pre>
6. Save and close the file.

**Using an IDE**

If running Tomcat from an IDE, such as IntelliJ, then `-Dtransport.guarantee="CONFIDENTIAL" -Dweb.rest.protocol="https"` should be added at the end of the Tomcat VM arguments for your Tomcat run configuration. It is not necessary to add these arguments when running tomcat from the command line or a systemd command because of the configured `CATALINA_OPTS` variable.


# Build and Run the OpenMPF Workflow Manager Web Application

Run the following commands to build OpenMPF and launch the web application. Use this value for `<configFile>`:
<br>`/home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf-build-tools/config-files/openmpf-example-package.json`

1. `cd /home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf`
2. Copy the development properties file into place:

    ```
    cp trunk/workflow-manager/src/main/resources/properties/mpf-private-example.properties trunk/workflow-manager/src/main/resources/properties/mpf-private.properties
    ```

3. Open `/etc/ansible/hosts` in a text editor. `sudo` is required to edit this file.
4. If they do not already exist, add these two lines above `# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers.` (line 11):

    ```
    [mpf-child]
    localhost.localdomain
    ```

5. Save and close the file.
6. `mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.test.skip=true -DskipITs -Dcargo.maven.skip=true  -Dcomponents.build.package.json=<configFile> -Dstartup.auto.registration.skip=false -Dcomponents.build.dir=/home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf/mpf-component-build`
7. `cd /home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf/trunk/workflow-manager`
8. `rm -rf /opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/workflow-manager*`
9. `cp target/workflow-manager.war /opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/workflow-manager.war`
10. `cd ../..`
11. `sudo cp trunk/install/libexec/node-manager /etc/init.d/`
12. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
13. `mpf start`

The web application should start running in the background as a daemon. Look for this log message in the Tomcat log (`/opt/apache-tomcat/logs/catalina.out`) with a time value indicating the Workflow Manager has finished starting:

```
INFO: Server startup in 39030 ms
```

After startup, the Workflow Manager will be available at <http://localhost:8080/workflow-manager> (or <https://localhost:8443/workflow-manager> if configured to use HTTPS instead of HTTP). Browse to this URL using FireFox or Chrome.

If you want to test regular user capabilities, log in as the "mpf" user with the "mpf123" password. Please see the [OpenMPF User Guide](User-Guide/index.html) for more information. Alternatively, if you want to test admin capabilities then log in as "admin" user with the "mpfadm" password. Please see the [OpenMPF Admin Guide](Admin-Guide/index.html) for more information. When finished using OpenMPF, run `mpf stop`.

The preferred method to start and stop services for OpenMPF is with the `mpf start` and `mpf stop` commands. For additional information on these commands, please see the [Command Line Tools](Admin-Guide/index.html#command-line-tools) section of the [OpenMPF Admin Guide](Admin-Guide/index.html). These will start and stop the ActiveMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis, Node Manager, and Tomcat system processes.

For debugging purposes, it may be helpful to manually start the Tomcat service in a separate terminal window to display the log output. To do that, use `mpf start --xtc` to start ActiveMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis, and the Node Manager without starting Tomcat. Then, in another terminal windows run:

```
/opt/apache-tomcat/bin/catalina.sh run
```

Press `ctrl-c` in the Tomcat window to stop Tomcat.


# (Optional) Test OpenMPF

Run the following commands to build OpenMPF and run the integration tests. Use this value for `<configFile>`:
<br>`/home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf-build-tools/config-files/openmpf-example-package.json`

1. `cd /home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf`
2. Copy the development properties file into place:

    ```
    cp trunk/workflow-manager/src/main/resources/properties/mpf-private-example.properties trunk/workflow-manager/src/main/resources/properties/mpf-private.properties
    ```

3. Open the file `/etc/ansible/hosts` in a text editor. `sudo` is required to edit this file.
4. If they do not already exist, add these two lines above `# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers.` (line 11):

    ```
    [mpf-child]
    localhost.localdomain
    ```

5. Save and close the file.
6. `mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -Dcargo.maven.skip=true -Dcomponents.build.package.json=<configFile> -Dcomponents.build.dir=/home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf/mpf-component-build -Dstartup.auto.registration.skip=false`
7. `sudo cp /home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf/trunk/install/libexec/node-manager /etc/init.d/`
8. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
9. `mpf start --xtc`
10. `mvn verify -Dtransport.guarantee="NONE" -Dweb.rest.protocol="http" -Dcargo.spring.profiles.active=jenkins -Dspring.profiles.active=jenkins -Dit.test='!ITWebUI' -Dcomponents.build.package.json=<configFile> -Dstartup.auto.registration.skip=false -Dcomponents.build.dir=/home/mpf/openmpf-projects/openmpf/mpf-component-build -Dstartup.auto.registration.skip=false`
11. `mpf stop --xtc`

Please see the appendix section [Known Issues](#known-issues) regarding any `java.lang.InterruptedException: null` warning log messages observed when running the tests.

Run this command to clean up and remove all traces of the test run:

1. `mpf clean --delete-uploaded-media --delete-logs`
2. Type "Y" and press Enter.

If you choose not to run `mpf clean` before following the [Build and Run the OpenMPF Workflow Manager Web Application](#build-and-run-the-openmpf-workflow-manager-web-application) steps, the Job Status table will be pre-populated with some entries; however, the input media, markup, and JSON output objects for those jobs will not be available.

# **Appendices**

# Command Line Tools

OpenMPF installs command line tools that can be accessed through a terminal on the development machine. All of the tools take the form of actions: `mpf <action> [options ...]`. Note that tab-completion is enabled for ease of use.

Execute `mpf --help` for general documentation and `mpf <action> --help` for documentation about a specific action.

  - **Start / Stop Actions**: Actions for starting and stopping the OpenMPF system dependencies, including PostgreSQL, ActiveMQ, Redis, Tomcat, and the node managers on the various nodes in the OpenMPF cluster.
    - `mpf status`: displays a message indicating whether each of the system dependencies is running or not
    - `mpf start`: starts all of the system dependencies
    - `mpf stop`: stops all of the system dependencies
    - `mpf restart` : stops and then starts all of the system dependencies
  - **User Actions**: Actions for managing Workflow Manager user accounts. If changes are made to an existing user then that user will need to log off or the Workflow Manager will need to be restarted for the changes to take effect.
    - `mpf list-users` : lists all of the existing user accounts and their role (non-admin or admin)
    - `mpf add-user <username> <role>`: adds a new user account; will be prompted to enter the account password
    - `mpf remove-user <username>` : removes an existing user account
    - `mpf change-role <username> <role>` : change the role (non-admin to admin or vice versa) for an existing user
    - `mpf change-password <username>`: change the password for an existing user; will be prompted to enter the new account password
  - **Clean Actions**: Actions to remove old data and revert the system to a new install state. User accounts, registered components, as well as custom actions, tasks, and pipelines, are preserved.
    - `mpf clean`: cleans out old job information and results, pending job requests, marked up media files, and ActiveMQ data, but preserves log files and uploaded media
    - `mpf clean --delete-logs --delete-uploaded-media`: the same as `mpf clean` but also deletes log files and uploaded media
- **Node Action**: Actions for managing node membership in the OpenMPF cluster.
    - `mpf list-nodes`: If the Workflow Manager is running, get the current JGroups view; otherwise, list the core nodes


## Packaging a Component

In a non-Docker deployment, admin users can register component packages through the web UI. Refer to [Component Registration](#component-registration).

Once the descriptor file is complete, as described in [Component Descriptor Reference](Component-Descriptor-Reference/index.html), the next step is to compile your component source code, and finally, create a .tar.gz package containing the descriptor file, component library, and all other necessary files.

The package should contain a top-level directory with a unique name that will not conflict with existing component packages that have already been developed. The top-level directory name should be the same as the `componentName`.

Within the top-level directory there must be a directory named “descriptor” with the descriptor JSON file in it. The name of the file must be “descriptor.json”.

Example:
```
//sample-component-1.0.0-tar.gz contents
SampleComponent/
  config/
  descriptor/
    descriptor.json
  lib/
```

### Installing and registering a component
The Component Registration web page, located in the Admin section of the OpenMPF web user interface, can be used to upload and register the component.

Drag and drop the .tar.gz file containing the component onto the dropzone area of that page. The component will automatically be uploaded and registered.

Upon successful registration, the component will be available for deployment onto OpenMPF nodes via the Node Configuration web page and `/rest/nodes/config` end point.

If the descriptor contains custom actions, tasks, or pipelines, then they will be automatically added to the system upon registration.

>**NOTE:** If the descriptor does not contain custom actions, tasks, or pipelines, then a default action, task, and pipeline will be generated and added to the system.
>
>The default action will use the component’s algorithm with its default property value settings.
The default task will use the default action.
The default pipeline will use the default task. This will only be generated if the algorithm does not specify any `requiresCollection` states.

### Unregistering a component
A component can be unregistered by using the remove button on the Component Registration page.

During unregistration, all services, algorithms, actions, tasks, and pipelines associated with the component are deleted. Additionally, all actions, tasks, and pipelines that depend on these elements are removed.


# Web UI

The following sections will cover some additional functionality permitted to admin users in a non-Docker deployment.

## Node Configuration and Status

This page provides a list of all of the services that are configured to run on the OpenMPF cluster:

![Node and Process Status Page](img/mpf-adm-node.png "Node and Process Status Page")

Each node shows information about the current status of each service, if it is unlaunchable due to an underlying error, and how many services are running for each node. If a service is unlaunchable, it will be indicated using a red status icon (not shown). Note that services are grouped by component type. Click the chevron ">" to expand a service group to view the individual services.

An admin user can start, stop, or restart them on an individual basis. If a non-admin user views this page, the "Action(s)" column is not displayed. This page also enables an admin user to edit the configuration for all nodes in the OpenMPF cluster. A non-admin user can only view the existing configuration.

An admin user can add a node by using the "Add Node" button and selecting a node in the OpenMPF cluster from the drop-down list. You an also select to add all services at this time. A node and all if its configured services can be removed by clicking the trash can to the right of the node's hostname.

An admin user can add services individually by selecting the node edit button at the bottom of the node. The number of service instances can be increased or decreased by using the drop-down. Click the "Submit" button to save the changes.

When making changes, please be aware of the following:

- It may take a minute for the configuration to take effect on the server.
- If you remove an existing service from a node, any job that service is processing will be stopped, and you will need to resubmit that job.
- If you create a new node, its configuration will not take effect until the OpenMPF software is properly installed and started on the associated host.
- If you delete a node, you will need to manually turn off the hardware running that node (deleting a node does not shut down the machine).

## Component Registration

This page allows an admin user to add and remove non-default components to and from the system:

![Component Registration Page](img/mpf-adm-component.png "Component Registration Page")

A component package takes the form of a tar.gz file. An admin user can either drag and drop the file onto the "Upload a new component" dropzone area or click the dropzone area to open a file browser and select the file that way. In either case, the component will begin to be uploaded to the system. If the admin user dragged and dropped the file onto the dropzone area then the upload progress will be shown in that area. Once uploaded, the workflow manager will automatically attempt to register the component. Notification messages will appear in the upper right side of the screen to indicate success or failure if an error occurs. The "Current Components" table will display the component status.

![Component Registration Page](img/mpf-adm-component2.png "Component Registration Page")

If for some reason the component package upload succeeded but the component registration failed then the admin user will be able to click the "Register" button again to try to another registration attempt. For example, the admin user may do this after reviewing the workflow manager logs and resolving any issues that prevented the component from successfully registering the first time. One reason may be that a component with the same name already exists on the system. Note that an error will also occur if the top-level directory of the component package, once extracted, already exists in the /opt/mpf/plugins directory on the system.

Once registered, an admin user has the option to remove the component. This will unregister it and completely remove any configured services, as well as the uploaded file and its extracted contents, from the system. Also, the component algorithm as well as any actions, tasks, and pipelines specified in the component's descriptor file will be removed when the component is removed.


# Known Issues

The following are known issues that are related to setting up and running OpenMPF. For a more complete list of known issues, please see the OpenMPF [Release Notes](Release-Notes/index.html) and [workboard](https://github.com/orgs/openmpf/projects/3?card_filter_query=label%3Abug).

**Test Exceptions**

When running the tests, you may observe warning log messages similar to this:

```

```

This does not necessarily indicate any type of software bug. The most likely cause for this message is that a test has timed out. Increasing the available system resources or increasing the test timeout values may help.


# Proxy Configuration

**Yum Package Manager Proxy Configuration**

Before using the yum package manager,  it may be necessary to configure it to work with your environment's proxy settings. If credentials are not required, it is not necessary to add them to the yum configuration.

1. `sudo bash -c 'echo "proxy=<address>:<port>" >> /etc/yum.conf'`
2. `sudo bash -c 'echo "proxy_username=<username>" >> /etc/yum.conf'`
3. `sudo bash -c 'echo "proxy_password=<password>" >> /etc/yum.conf'`

**Proxy Environment Variables**

If your build environment is behind a proxy server, some applications and tools will need to be configured to use it. To configure an HTTP and HTTPS proxy, run the following commands. If credentials are not required, leave those fields blank.

1. `sudo bash -c 'echo "export http_proxy=<username>:<password>@<url>:<port>" >> /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh`
2. `. /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh`
3. `sudo bash -c 'echo "export https_proxy='${http_proxy}'" >> /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh'`
4. `sudo bash -c 'echo "export HTTP_PROXY='${http_proxy}'" >> /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh'`
5. `sudo bash -c 'echo "export HTTPS_PROXY='${http_proxy}'" >> /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh'`
6. `. /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh`

**Git Proxy Configuration**

If your build environment is behind a proxy server, git will need to be configured to use it. The following command will set the git global proxy. If the environment variable `$http_proxy` is not set, use the full proxy server address, port, and credentials (if needed).

```
git config --global http.proxy $http_proxy
```

**Firefox Proxy Configuration**

Before running the integration tests and the web application, it may be necessary to configure Firefox with your environment's proxy settings.

1. In a new terminal window, type `firefox` and press enter. This will launch a new Firefox window.
2. In the new Firefox window, enter `about:preferences#advanced` in the URL text box and press enter.
3. In the left sidebar click "Advanced", then click the `Network` tab, and in the `Connection` section press the "Settings..." button.
4. Enter the proxy settings for your environment.
5. In the "No Proxy for:" text box, verify that `localhost` is included.
6. Press the "OK" button.
7. Close all open Firefox instances.

**Maven Proxy Configuration**

Before using Maven, it may be necessary to configure it to work with your environment's proxy settings. Open a new terminal window and run these commands. Afterwards, continue with adding the additional maven dependencies.

1. `cd /home/mpf`
2. `mkdir -p .m2`
3. `cp /opt/apache-maven/conf/settings.xml .m2/`
4. Open the file `.m2/settings.xml` in a text editor.
5. Navigate to the `<proxies>` section (line 85).
6. There is a commented-out example proxy server specification. Copy and paste the example specification below the commented-out section, but before the end of the closing `</proxies>` tag.
7. Fill in your environment's proxy server information. For additional help and information, please see the Apache Maven guide to configuring a proxy server at <https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html>.


# SSL Inspection

If your build environment is behind a proxy server that performs SSL inspection, some applications and tools will need to be configured to accommodate it. The following steps will add trusted certificates to your development machine.

Additional information on Java keytool can be found at <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html>.

1. Download any certificates needed for using SSL in your build environment to `/home/mpf/Downloads`.
2. For each certificate, run this command, filling in the values for certificate alias, certificate name, and keystore passphrase:
    <br> `sudo $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -import -alias <certificate alias> -file /home/mpf/Downloads/<certificate name>.crt -keystore "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts" -storepass <keystore passphrase> -noprompt`
3. For each certificate, run this command, filling in the value for certificate name:
    <br> `sudo cp /home/mpf/Downloads/<certificate name>.crt /tmp`
4. For each certificate, run this command, filling in the values for certificate name:
    <br> `sudo -u root -H sh -c "openssl x509 -in /tmp/<certificate name>.crt    -text > /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/<certificate name>.pem"`
5. Run these commands once:
    1. `sudo -u root -H sh -c "update-ca-trust enable"`
    2. `sudo -u root -H sh -c "update-ca-trust extract"`
6. Run these commands once, filling in the value for the root certificate name:
    1. `sudo cp /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt.original`
    2. `sudo -u root -H sh -c "cat /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/<root certificate name>.pem >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt"`

Alternatively, if adding certificates is not an option, or difficulties are encountered, you may optionally skip SSL certificate verification for these tools. This is not recommended:

**wget**

1. `cd /home/mpf`
2. `touch /home/mpf/.wgetrc`
3. In a text editor, open the file `/home/mpf/.wgetrc`
4. Add this line:

    ```
    check_certificate=off
    ```

5. Save and close the file.
6. `. /home/mpf/.wgetrc`

**git**

1. `cd /home/mpf`
2. `git config http.sslVerify false`
3. `git config --global http.sslVerify false`

**maven**

1. In a text editor, open the file `/etc/profile.d/mpf.sh`
2. At the bottom of the file, add this line:
<pre><code>export MAVEN_OPTS="-Dmaven.wagon.http.ssl.insecure=true -Dmaven.wagon.http.ssl.allowall=true -Dmaven.wagon.http.ssl.ignore.validity.dates=true"</code></pre>
3. Save and close the file.
4. `. /etc/profile.d/mpf.sh`
