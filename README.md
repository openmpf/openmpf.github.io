# OpenMPF Web Site

Welcome to the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) Web Site Project!

## What is OpenMPF?

OpenMPF provides a platform to perform content detection and extraction on bulk multimedia, enabling users to analyze, search, and share information through the extraction of objects, keywords, thumbnails, and other contextual data.

OpenMPF enables users to build configurable media processing pipelines, enabling the rapid development and deployment of analytic algorithms and large-scale media processing applications.

### Search and Share

Simplify large-scale media processing and enable the extraction of meaningful content

### Open API

Apply cutting-edge algorithms such as face detection and object classification

### Flexible Architecture

Integrate into your existing environment or use OpenMPF as a standalone application
